# Startup Idea Evaluator

This is a **React Native + Expo** mobile app that allows users to submit startup ideas, get an AI-generated rating & feedback, and vote for the best ideas.  
It was built as a learning project to explore **React Native, Expo, navigation, and local storage**.
##  Features

- View all ideas in a clean list
- Sort ideas by **Rating, Votes, or Newest**

## Student Notes

This project is **for learning purposes only**.
The "AI rating" is just a random score generator and **not an actual AI model**.
